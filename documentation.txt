1) Set up the virtual environment using `python -m venv echelon_env`  
2) Installed required dependencies: OpenAI, Whisper, PyAudio, etc.  
3) Created `speech_to_text.py` to transcribe audio files using Whisper.  
4) Created `record_audio.py` to record audio from the microphone and save it as a WAV file.  
5) Integrated microphone input and transcription in `real_time_speech_to_text.py`.  
6) Implemented logging using a custom `logging_module`.  
7) Tested Whisper model loading and audio transcription.  
8) Handled errors related to Whisper model and PyAudio installation.  
9) Added functionality to calculate and log transcription time.  
10) Used GPT-4-turbo for persuasion analysis in `ai_analysis.py`.  
11) Integrated feedback generation for persuasion coaching in `ai_coaching.py`.  
12) Developed a real-time audio input and transcription pipeline for testing.  
13) Prepared `real_time_speech_to_text.py` to handle both recording and transcription in real-time.  
14) Implemented simple error handling for transcription and recording errors.  
15) Tested real-time transcription by recording 5-second audio samples.  
16) Plan to enhance real-time transcription for continuous feedback.
