1) Set up the virtual environment using `python -m venv echelon_env`  
2) Installed required dependencies: OpenAI, Whisper, PyAudio, etc.  
3) Created `speech_to_text.py` to transcribe audio files using Whisper.  
4) Created `record_audio.py` to record audio from the microphone and save it as a WAV file.  
5) Integrated microphone input and transcription in `real_time_speech_to_text.py`.  
6) Implemented logging using a custom `logging_module`.  
7) Tested Whisper model loading and audio transcription.  
8) Handled errors related to Whisper model and PyAudio installation.  
9) Added functionality to calculate and log transcription time.  
10) Used GPT-4-turbo for persuasion analysis in `ai_analysis.py`.  
11) Integrated feedback generation for persuasion coaching in `ai_coaching.py`.  
12) Developed a real-time audio input and transcription pipeline for testing.  
13) Prepared `real_time_speech_to_text.py` to handle both recording and transcription in real-time.  
14) Implemented simple error handling for transcription and recording errors.  
15) Tested real-time transcription by recording 5-second audio samples.  
16) Plan to enhance real-time transcription for continuous feedback.
17) Implemented alternative transcription using Wav2Vec2 model in `speech_to_text_wav2vec.py`.
18) Added structured JSON response format for AI analysis using Gemini Pro.
19) Fixed JSON parsing issues in speech analysis by using regex extraction.
20) Improved error handling and logging for API key validation and quota limits.
21) Successfully tested end-to-end pipeline with sample audio files.
22) Achieved transcription times of ~2-3 seconds for short audio clips.
23) Added detailed logging of transcription results and analysis scores.
24) Implemented proper exception handling for model loading and API calls.
25) Tested with multiple audio formats including live microphone input.
