1) I make this good enough to be of use for myself and others

2) I make this good enough to pitch in front of others 

3) I pitch this to rich and elite people 

4) If they refuse (which they most likely will), I challenge them to tell me what specific feature would they want in this to buy this product's subscription

A realistic approach would be to make this good enough to be of use for myself and others.
